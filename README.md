My name is Kellen Murphy, I'm an cosmologist turned software engineer. I specialize in building and supporting Identity and Access Managment solutions built around SAML and OAuth 2.0 / OIDC, including:

- Shibboleth
- SimpleSAMLphp
- Microsoft ADFS
- Azure AD
- AWS Cognito
- Keycloak

The complete list of "stuff I work with" is far too long to list here, but I'm a daily user of PHP, Python, and Javascript. I've also spent more time with Java than I'd have liked to but generally only within the Shibboleth IDP customization space.
