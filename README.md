My name is Kellen Murphy, I'm an cosmologist-turned-engineer with [@idmengineering](https://github.com/idmengineering) and [@bcsengineering](https://github.com/bcsengineering). It was kind of a long and winding road to get to where I am today, and as a result I've got familiarity with a LOT of different technologies and stacks, coupled with the well-honed problem solving skills of a classically trained physicist.

My main area of responsibility is partnering with clients to develop Identity and Access Managment solutions built around SAML and OAuth 2.0 / OIDC:

- Shibboleth
- Microsoft ADFS
- Azure AD
- AWS Cognito
- Keycloak

The complete list of "stuff I work with" is far too long to list here, but I'm a daily user of PHP, Python, and Javascript. I've also spent more time with Java than I'd have liked to but generally only within the Shibboleth IDP customization space.
